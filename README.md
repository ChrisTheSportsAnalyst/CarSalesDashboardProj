The Car Sales Dashboard project is a comprehensive Power BI initiative aimed at delivering an interactive and dynamic overview of a company's performance in car sales. 
The dashboard encompasses key features such as dynamic filtering, detailed grid views, and various charts, providing stakeholders with valuable insights through metrics like year-to-date sales and 
month-to-date total sales. The project extensively employs Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions, including Avg Price, MTD Avg Price, and YoY Avg Price Growth, enhancing the depth of analysis. 
The entire project, along with the Power BI file, has been saved as a PDF for easy sharing. Stakeholders can access the Power BI dashboard through the provided link.
Additionally, the detailed description of the project and the DAX functions used is available in the attached Word document, offering a comprehensive understanding of the analytics and calculations applied
